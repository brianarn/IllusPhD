## The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D

I wanted to get some work in with dojox.gfx, and building up the graphics as shown at [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/) seems like a great way to do so - so here it is.

Thankfully, Matt licensed his imagery under a Creative Commons license (details on his page), and so I can remix/use the ideas here. CC and open source go hand in hand philosophically in many ways, so the code here is all under a BSD license.
